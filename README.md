# Dynamic EV Charging Automation for Home Assistant

This project automates the charging current of an electric vehicle based on household power consumption.  
It works with **any EV (Tesla, Mercedes, Ford, BYD, etc.)** or **any EV charger** as long as it is integrated and can be controlled within Home Assistant.

This blueprint dynamically adjusts the charging rate, ensuring that the vehicle uses the **maximum available power** without exceeding the contracted limit.  
It also supports **different power limits for day and night** to optimize charging based on electricity tariffs.

## üîß Requirements

Before using this blueprint, you need the following:

- **Total Power Consumption Sensor** (e.g., <a href="https://amzlink.to/az0UFbhU9htEu" target=_blank>Shelly EM Gen3</a> is recommended if you don‚Äôt have one. You can get it from that link).
- **Your EV or Charger integrated into Home Assistant**, exposing the necessary sensors. I use this <a href="https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_opa4tdi" target=_blank>Feyree portable charger</a>, I haven't tested with any other.
- **Basic information about your electricity contract**, including:
  - Grid voltage (e.g., 230V for EU, 120V for the US).
  - Maximum grid power limits (contracted power).
  - Day and night tariff periods (if applicable).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The following parameters need to be configured:

- **Charging interval** (1, 3, or 5 minutes).
- **A device tracker** (preferably the car) to ensure that the automation runs only when the EV is at home.
- **A charging status sensor** to ensure changes are only made when the EV is actively charging.
- **Total power consumption sensor** (measured in watts).
- **Maximum Grid Power (Day)** ‚Äì Set to **0** if you only want to charge at night.
- **Maximum Grid Power (Night)**.
- **Charging current control entity** ‚Äì The EV or charger must support dynamic amperage control.
- **Grid voltage**.
- **Maximum charging amperage** ‚Äì The system will never exceed this limit, even if extra power is available.
- **Minimum charging amperage** ‚Äì The system will stop charging if power availability drops below this threshold.
- **Day-time period settings** (Define when "day" mode applies, typically when electricity is more expensive or power is limited).

## üöÄ How It Works

The automation runs every **1, 3, or 5 minutes**, depending on the selected interval.  
It **only** adjusts the charging rate if the EV is **charging** and **at home**.  

### **Dynamic Load Adjustment**
The automation continuously monitors household power usage and dynamically **adjusts the charging current** to avoid exceeding the contracted power limit.  
If a high-power appliance (e.g., oven, stove, heating) is turned on, the charging rate will **automatically decrease** to prevent overloading.  
Once power consumption drops, the EV will **resume charging at the maximum allowed rate**.

### **Day & Night Power Limits**
Many electricity contracts offer **cheaper power at night**, along with **higher power limits**.  
This blueprint allows setting **different power limits for day and night**, ensuring that charging is optimized based on your tariff structure.
